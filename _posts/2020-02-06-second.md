# How to approach your NLP problem

In this post I'll try to give you some hint for your solving your NLP tasks. 

## Surf!

When you are trying to solve an NLP task, generally speaking, I always suggest to first have a look what's into "the wild". 
Surfing on the web using the correct keywords plays an important role here. 
In this field there is a tremendous sparsity of terms and synonyms, as well as an huge amount of sub-fields and sub-tasks, 
bringing the number of possible combinations of this terms to explode.

Depending on your knowledge of the field/litterature and your "scraper" skills, you can find a lot of usefull information, and also code.
At the end of the day, if you are lucky, you have to adapt and run some code to be able to run on your data and provide some result.
In the worst case scenario you will have to implement by scratch what you find out in a paper or post.

My personal preferences and suggestions are [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/area/natural-language-processing) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) but also 
[Github](https://github.com/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/) have good references. 

## Keep your portfolio and pipeline.

Whenever you find a solution try to keep the code as much reusable as possible, so that you can have your set of sub-modules.
This is always a dream, however sometimes could happen that your code cannot be completely re-used or either because it's not clean or for other reasons (e.g company code integration) .
In any case there are general high level procedures which can be applied to the same categories of problems, for which you can have your pipeline ready!

Think about a general NLP classification problem, or a regression one. What you usually do, before even going into building sci-fi models and super-deep neural networks, is to analyze and properly clean the data.
So, what I suggest are two basic pipelines:
1. Data cleaning
2. Data analysis
